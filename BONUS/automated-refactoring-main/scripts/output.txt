Design Smells Found: ### Potential Design Smells:
1. **Composite Key**: The `UserBookTag` entity is using composite keys (`id`, `userBookId`, `tagId`) marked with `@Id`. While composite keys are valid in JPA, they can make the code harder to understand and maintain. Consider using a single primary key or a surrogate key instead.

2. **Missing Constructors**: The class lacks any constructors. It's a good practice to provide at least a default no-argument constructor and a constructor that initializes all fields. This can help with object creation and immutability.

3. **Inconsistent Naming**: The naming convention for getters and setters is inconsistent. For example, `getUserBookId()` and `setUserBookId()`. It's better to follow a consistent naming convention like `getPropertyName()` and `setPropertyName()`.

4. **Lack of Validation**: There is no validation of input parameters in the setter methods. It's a good practice to validate input parameters to ensure data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.

5. **Overriding `hashCode()` but not `equals()**: The `hashCode()` method is overridden, but the `equals()` method is also important to override when dealing with entity objects. Make sure to implement `equals()` method properly to maintain consistency.

6. **Dependency on Guava Library**: The code is using `Objects.toStringHelper()` from the Guava library for generating the `toString()` representation. Consider using standard Java methods for generating the `toString()` representation to reduce external dependencies.

7. **Magic Number in `hashCode()`**: The `hashCode()` method uses a magic number `31` for calculation. Consider using a more meaningful constant or formula to calculate the hash code.

8. **Unused `serialVersionUID`**: The `serialVersionUID` field is defined but not used. If serialization is not needed, consider removing this field.

Overall, the code could benefit from refactoring to improve readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices in Java development.
