# Tasks

## Task 1 - 30

1. Identify relevant classes
2. Document functionality and behaviour
3. Create UML diagrams
4. Observations and comments
5. Assumptions

## Task 2 - 30

1. (2a) Detect 5-7 design smells using the tools mentioned above, especially Sonarqube. (Make sure that you list
design smells, not code smells)
2. (2b) Code Metrics Analysis: Employ code analysis tools (e.g., CodeMR,
Checkstyle, PMD) to extract up to 6 relevant code metrics for the project.
3. Tools Used: Clearly state the tools used for the code metrics analysis and
ensure that the selected tools provide a reliable and accurate representation
of the project's codebase
4. Implications Discussion: For each identified metric, discuss its implications
in the context of software quality, maintainability, and potential performance
issues. Provide insights into how each metric reflects on the project's current
state.

## Task 3 - 40

1. (3a) You previously identified 5-7 design smells. Now, the goal is to rectify these issues
through code refactoring without fundamentally altering the existing codebase
2. (3b) Following the refactoring process, it's time to reassess the metrics measured earlier.
Have they seen improvements or deterioration? I
3. (3c) Leveraging Large Language Models for Refactoring
